<h1 class="H">Hula</h1>
<p class="P">With her flower crown and grass skirt, the hula girl has been synonymous with Hawaiian hospitality since cruise ships first docked in Honolulu in the 1920s. Even today, exoticized images of these traditional dancers headline on travel websites, at tiki-themed bars, and on wiggly dashboard tchotchkes.

Over the past two centuries, the cherished Hawaiian dance has moved from a sacred religious practice to a tourist attraction, along the way falling prey to cultural appropriation and near erasure.</p><br>
<p class="P">For Hawaiians, hula is a living archive of their history and stories. Preserving it is their kuleana (responsibility). <q>Hula is our highest expression of who we are. It's our language put into motion,</q> says Mapuana de Silva, a kumu hula who has been teaching hula on O'ahu since 1976.</p>
